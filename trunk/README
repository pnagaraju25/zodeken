*** FEATURES ***

- Supports only MySQL.

- Generates DbTables, DbTable_Rows, DbTable_Rowsets with DocBlock tags that
gives you autocompletion when coding in an IDE.

- Defines DbTable's $_dependentTables and $_referenceMap following InnoDB's
relationships.

- Adds some commonly used methods to DbTable: fetchPairs (an array of
key => value pairs), fetchOne (value of first column's first field), fetchOnes
(an array that is a list of fetchOne).

- You are free to add custom methods to DbTable, Row, Rowset, Form or Mapper.
Basic methods like fetchOne(), fetchPairs(), fetchOnes(), setters, getters...
are added to abstract classes of them. Those abstract class files will be
overwritten when you re-run the generator.

With forms, latest Zodeken-generated classes will be put in
(Application_)Form_Edit[TableName]_Latest, you can compare this with current
version (Application_)Form_Edit[TableName] to add or change the code as
necessary to it.

- Detects the relationships between the tables and generates basically necessary
methods.

    One-to-many:
        $memberRow->getPostRowsetByAuthorId()
        $postRow->getMemberRowByAuthorId()

    Many-to-many:
        $tagRow->getPostRows()
        $postRow->getTagRows()

- Uses proper form element for each data type. For example:
    enum/set -> radio
    varchar/char -> text
    text/longtext -> textarea
    foreign key -> select
    ...

- Adds validators and filters depending on data type of the field. For example:

    InArray for ENUM/SET
    Int for INT
    Float for BIGINT/DECIMAL/FLOAT
    ->setRequired(true) for 'NOT NULL' fields
    StringLength(array('max' => 100)) for fields that have 100 char. limit

- Adds a drop-down list for a foreign key field to the form:

    $tableCategory = new Application_Model_Category_DbTable();
    $this->addElement(
        $this->createElement('select', 'category_id')
            ->setLabel('Category Id')
            ->setMultiOptions(array("" => "- - Select - -")
                + $tableCategory->fetchPairs())
            ->setRequired(true)
            ->setDecorators($this->elementDecorators)
    );

*** INSTALLATION ***

1. Download latest version from http://code.google.com/p/zodeken/downloads/list

2. Place the folder Zodeken into a folder that covered by your include_path

library, for example:

    /usr/share/php/
        Zend/
        Zodeken/

3. Edit your .zf.ini (usually located at your home folder), append this line:

    basicloader.classes.20 = "Zodeken_ZfTool_ZodekenProvider"

You may change the number 20 to another one that you prefer.

If don't know where that file is located, you may run:

    zf --setup config-file

The command 'zf' not found??? Read this first:
