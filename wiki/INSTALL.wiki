1. Get the latest version
{{{
svn checkout http://zodeken.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ mylib
}}}

2. Place the folder Zodeken into a folder that covered by your include_path
setting. Or simply, just place Zodeken into the same folder with your Zend 
library, for example:
{{{
    /usr/share/php/
        Zend/
        Zodeken/
}}}

3. Edit your .zf.ini (usually located at your home folder), append this line:
{{{
    basicloader.classes.20 = "Zodeken_ZfTool_ZodekenProvider"
}}}
You may change the number 20 to another one that you prefer.

If don't know where that file is located, you may run:

{{{
    zf --setup config-file
}}}

The command 'zf' not found??? Read this first: [http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.tool.framework.clitool.html]

4. Done
